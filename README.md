YouTube Video to MP3 Downloader:

This is a Python application that allows users to download YouTube videos as MP3 files. The program uses Selenium to automate browser interactions and convert YouTube videos to MP3 using an online service. The user interface is built with Tkinter for simplicity and ease of use.


Features:

Search YouTube Videos: Search for YouTube videos by name.
Convert to MP3: Automatically convert the selected YouTube video to an MP3 file.
Automated Download: The application will download the MP3 file directly to your computer without prompting you to select a save location.
Customizable Search: Users can input the name of any song or video to convert.


Requirements:

Python 3.x: Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Download from Python.org.
Selenium: A browser automation tool used to interact with YouTube and the MP3 conversion site.
ChromeDriver/BraveDriver: Selenium requires a browser driver for automation. In this project, we use Brave Browser, but Chrome can also be used.
Tkinter: A GUI toolkit used for building the user interface.
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library used to display an image in the GUI.


Browser Setup:

This application uses Brave as the browser for downloading, but you can also use Google Chrome. Make sure to download and install the browser of your choice and provide the correct path to the executable in the downloaddd() function.


Brave Browser: Make sure you have Brave installed. You can download it from Brave's website.
ChromeDriver: For Chrome, download ChromeDriver.


How to Use:

Launch the Application: Run the Python script to start the Tkinter interface.
Enter Song Name: Enter the name of the song you want to download in the input box.
Click Download: Once you press the "Download" button, the script will search YouTube for the song, retrieve the video link, and initiate the MP3 conversion.
Download MP3: After the conversion, the MP3 file will be downloaded directly to your default download folder.


Code Overview:

Selenium WebDriver: Uses Selenium to open YouTube, search for the song, and retrieve the video URL.
MP3 Conversion: Automates the process of pasting the YouTube URL into a conversion website (e.g., Y2Mate) and downloading the MP3 file.
Tkinter GUI: The GUI provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the song name and download it with a single click.


Example:

Launch the application.
Enter the name of the song you want to download in the text box, say "Every Breath You Take"
Press "Download" to begin the process.
The MP3 will automatically download to your default downloads folder.
